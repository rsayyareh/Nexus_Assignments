# 1
#   f(f^(x)) = x        f^: invers of f

# 2
#       sinÂ²(x) in ptython is sin(x)**2
#       linespace in numpy is similar to arange 

# 3
#       first line, 400 is the points between -1 and 1 and can not be more
#       than 1, the 0.01 is good enough number to have an accurate plot.

#       symbols could be inserted using ASCII code in text.

# 5
#       derivativ of one variable function (y=f(x)) is 
#       the same as partial derivatives (gradient).

# 6
#       symbolic gradient determination using sympy library
